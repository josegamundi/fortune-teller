# Message Generator: Fortune Teller

## Description

A program that generates random fortune predictions by combining multiple pieces of data preset in its source code.

## How it works

The program will visit each column of the table below, randomly selecting a cell or piece of text to form a message that will tell the fortune of the person who execute the program.

| Time | Subject + Modal Verb | Main Verb | Noun |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tomorrow | you will | find | a new highly paid job |
| In one year from now | you are going to | encounter  | your soulmate |
| By the end of the week | you have to | think about | how this ends |
| Today |  | face |  |
|  |  | lose |  |
